## Folder Descriptions

### 01_MCAL/01_DIO

This folder contains the Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL) for Digital I/O functionalities. It provides abstraction and interfaces for handling digital input and output operations.

### 02_HAL/01_LED

The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for LED interfacing resides in this directory. It encapsulates LED-related operations, making it easier to work with LEDs connected to the microcontroller.

### 03_APP

This directory houses the application code, which typically includes the main program or various applications using the functionalities provided by MCAL and HAL layers.

### 04_LIB

The 04_LIB directory may include additional libraries or external dependencies required for the project.

Feel free to add specific details or explanations for each folder as needed.
